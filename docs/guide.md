# Developer Guide

## Getting Started

All you need to include in the HTML is the bundled JavaScript in the HTML head, this is served from the jsDelivr CDN, e.g. `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/benc-uk/touchmidi@v2.0.0/dist/bundle.js`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Touch Midi 2 [My Layout]</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/benc-uk/touchmidi@v2.0.0/dist/bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- PUT YOUR WIDGETS HERE -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Create an empty HTML file and paste the contents below.  
Note. You can specify any version tag (see [releases](./releases)) after the @ or use `@main` if you're feeling brave.
